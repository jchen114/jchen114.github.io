## Welcome to my Github IO site.

Here, I list the projects that I have completed or are in progress.

* [OpenAI Gym](https://jchen114.github.io/OpenAIGym/) - A place where I implement various RL algorithms to solve OpenAI environments.
* [LSTM Algebraic Generator](https://jchen114.github.io/LSTM-Algebra-Generator/) - An example using LSTM networks to generate valid Algebraic sequences that have time dependencies.
* [Fire Hydrant Survival Game](https://jchen114.github.io/Fire-Hydrant-Survival/) - A 2D arcade style game made in Unity where you are a fire hydrant and you have to keep dogs away squirting them with water.
* [WEB SIMBICON](https://jchen114.github.io/SIMBICON-Web) - An online implementation using Ammo.js with THREE.js of SIMBICON which is a framework for producing bipedal gaits. Editable parameters to make different gaits!
