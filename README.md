## Welcome to my Github IO site.

Here, I list the projects that I have completed or are in progress.

* [OpenAI Gym](https://jchen114.github.io/OpenAIGym/) - A place where I implement various RL algorithms to solve OpenAI environments. **Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Networks**
* [LSTM Algebraic Generator](https://jchen114.github.io/LSTM-Algebra-Generator/) - An example using LSTM networks to generate valid Algebraic sequences that have time dependencies. **Keywords: Sequence Generation, LSTM Networks, Deep Learning, Machine Learning**
* [Fire Hydrant Survival Game](https://jchen114.github.io/Fire-Hydrant-Survival/) - A 2D arcade style game made in Unity where you are a fire hydrant and you have to keep dogs away squirting them with water. **Keywords: Unity, C#, Game development**
* [WEB SIMBICON](https://jchen114.github.io/SIMBICON-Web) - An online implementation using Ammo.js with THREE.js of SIMBICON which is a framework for producing bipedal gaits. Editable parameters to make different gaits! **Keywords: Physics, Javascript, Controllers**
* [Master's Thesis](https://jchen114.github.io/ContactSimulation/) - My Master's Thesis project. I predict slope and ground compliance that a bipedal character is traversing across using multilayer LSTM Networks! **Keywords: Deep Learning, LSTM Networks, Bullet Physics, OpenGL, C++, Python**
* [Koolhaus Interview Question](https://github.com/jchen114/Koolhaus) - An interview question that I completed and received from Koolhaus games. **Keywords: C++, OOP, Vector math**
* [Silver Dice Interview Question](https://jchen114.github.io/Throwing-Balls/) - An interview question that I completed and received from Silver Dice games. **Keywords: Unreal Engine 4, Blueprints, VR**
