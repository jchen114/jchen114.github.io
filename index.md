## Welcome to my Github IO site.

Here, I list the projects that I have completed or are in progress.

* [OpenAI Gym](https://jchen114.github.io/OpenAIGym/) - A place where I implement various RL algorithms to solve OpenAI environments.
* [LSTM Algebraic Generator](https://jchen114.github.io/LSTM-Algebra-Generator/) - An example using LSTM networks to generate valid Algebraic sequences that have time dependencies.
